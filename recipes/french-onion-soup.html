    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>French onion soup is a soup of onions, gently fried and then cooked in meat stock or water, usually served gratin√©ed with croutons or a larger piece of bread covered with cheese floating on top. Onion soups were known in France since medieval times, but the version now familiar dates from the mid-19th century.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>unsalted butter</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>sliced onions</li>
        <li>beef broth</li>
        <li>dry sherry</li>
        <li>dried thyme</li>
        <li>salt & pepper</li>
        <li>french bread</li>
        <li>provolone cheese</li>
        <li>swiss cheese</li>
        <li>parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter with olive oil in an 8-quart stock pot over medium heat. Add onions to butter and continually stir until tender and translucent. Do not brown the onions.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth, sherry, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Let simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into oven-safe serving bowls and place one slice of bread on top of each (bread may be broken into pieces if you prefer). Layer each slice of bread with a slice of provolone, 1/2 slice diced Swiss and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Place bowls on a cookie sheet and broil in the preheated oven until cheese bubbles and browns slightly, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
